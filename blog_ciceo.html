            <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
                and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
                pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
                rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
                pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
                occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us
                ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?</p>

            <p>But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
                consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we
                denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
                pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are
                bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which
                is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
                distinguish.</p>

            <p>In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
                what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances
                and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures
                have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to
                this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures
                pains to avoid worse pains. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
                and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
                teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,
                dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
                pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone
                who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
                circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
                example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from
                it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
